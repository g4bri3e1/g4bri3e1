Hello guys, my name is Gabriel, I'm a pharmacist and a programming enthusiast. I have experience in molecular modeling and basic programming in Python. In addition, I have been studying programming to automate processes and the functioning of neural networks. I would like to contribute to projects that involve these topics. #python #pharmacy #pharmacist #amber #molecularmodeling #biochemistry #neuralnetworks
